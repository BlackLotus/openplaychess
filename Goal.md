What's this all about?

# Introduction #

Long time ago I bought my Fritz 7 and played happily online. But since I could not stand windows anymore and jumped over to linux I was unable to play with my old friends of the chess club.
And long time there was no good chess gui for linux at least in my humble opinion till I found pychess (http://pychess.googlecode.com/) with this I could play on fics and it was not a pain to play with.But still no "Playchess" Support.
So I decided to write a library so I can play again.

# Details #

Because I want it integrated in pychess I will write a python library.
But if for any reason someone besides me need this library and not in python I will try to provide as much info so he/she can write his/her own library without wasting hours reverse engineering.
