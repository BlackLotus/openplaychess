#labels Authentication
The pure Authenticating mechanism

= Introduction =
On the old Fritz 7 the chess server was fritzserver.de and schach.de port 6002 the protocol hasn't changed since then but it's now playchess.com and port 23.


= Details =

Here the first authentication will be described with hex code.

Auth (one request):
First the start bytes

43 c5 65 5f

After this the server knows that a valid client tries to connect to it.

Then there are 2 maybe random hex values

wx yz

Then there is the old bud

d3

fallowed by 

a6/66/26

not all of them but one of them maybe this is random too.
Next random string (I always say random but I just don't know what the string means)

xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx

everytime the same:
00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 f2 02 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

random again

wx yz


everytime the same

00 00 c2 0f 00 00 73 f9 9a d3 13 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 08 00 00 00

and now comes the first interesting part in it :P the username

he:xu:se:rn:am:e 

The next singnals that the username ends here

c4 ff 01

And the rest is filled with zeros

00:00:00 ....

The username can be 29 "hexchars" long.

I will upload by time a simple auth poc.
